#VictorBotge Bot

This bot tweets and 'inflated' version of any tweet which @ mentions 'him'. 

It was made using [these instructions](https://github.com/dariusk/examplebot) as inspiration on the technical side and the late, great Victor Borge's inflationary language routine as artistic inspiration.

##Why's it here? 

There's nothing too, too interesting here (or should that be three, three interesting) but Since I made this as part of a hack day I figured if it could be of any use to anyone trying to accomplish something similar why not make it visible.

So hey enjoy looking at my terribly hackish code... ;)
